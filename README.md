# click_playground
This repo provides the playground to play around with Kohler-Click Framework(https://github.com/kohler/click).

This playground enables user to create a Click-based Router using the existing Click-Elements(building-blocks of Click-https://github.com/kohler/click/wiki) and enables user to write newer Click-elements and Click-scripts(Click-Testies).

This framework is ideal for Click-Developers to learn/write/debug the existing and newer click-elements.
